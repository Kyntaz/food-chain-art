# Food Chain art
A python notebook that implements a food chain simmulation and generates smokey animations from the simmulation.
The videos don't work in the browser, so I guess  you have to clone the project or download the notebook to really see it.
Much of the content is randomized, so feel free to run the notebook yourself to see what results you get!
Oh, and it uses Pillow instead of PIL, so keep that in mind!

Check an online version of the notebook [here](https://kyntaz.github.io/food-chain-art/).
